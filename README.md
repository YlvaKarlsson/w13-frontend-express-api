W13-simple frontend for Express API.
Still have some details that needs to be fixed but leaving it for now since the frontend was strecth goals/black level so will try more with upcoming projects.
The red/black broder/background are there to try to fix some issues with styling, any help or ideas regarding them would be appreciated from my side.
